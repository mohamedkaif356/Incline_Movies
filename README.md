# Incline_Movies
Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch. I have used all the advance components of Android.

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the Popular, Trending and Upcoming Movies.
* Search Movies. 
* Create favorite and watch list of movies locally.
* Watch trailers.
* Read reviews and details.

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.
